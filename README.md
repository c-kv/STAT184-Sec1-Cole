# STAT 184 Activity 12
This repository contains the work I completed for Activity 9 for STAT 184. This activity involved building data visualizations using the `ggplot2` library in R. In this activity, I worked with three datasets:
1. `ggplot2::diamonds` A [datatset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) containing the prices and other attributes for almost 54,000 diamonds.
2. `palmerpenguins::penguins` A [dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) containing species, island, and other attributes for 344 penguins.
3. `dcData::BabyNames` A [dataset](https://github.com/mdbeckman/dcData) containing frequencies of baby names, and other attributes for all names with at least 5 occurances.
